                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Hoi An was a bustling international trading port in Southeast Asia from the 15th to the 19th century.

                <figcaption><i>Although large-scale trading had long moved elsewhere, Hoi An has been successful in preserving and restoring its charming roots and was recognized as the World Heritage by UNESCO in 1998</i></figcaption>
            </figure><br/>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Nowadays, Hoi An is one of the most famous tourist destinations in Vietnam.. <br/>

                         
                        <br/>
                        Tradition is still very much alive in the Old Town, even though many of the old shops have been converted to modern businesses which aim to foreigners and tourists, Hoi An is considered as a living museum of architecture and urban lifestyle
                        <br/>
                        <br/>                       
                         Most traditional houses here are the combination of different architectures from different cultures such as Chinese, Japanese, French, and British and of course Vietnamese style.

                        <figcaption><i>The great thing about Hoi An’s Old Town is that it is small enough to get around on foot. All Hoi An’s major attractions or landmarks are located within walking distance, and some of the streets are only for pedestrians</i></figcaption>
            </figure>        
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">For those who love sea, sun, and sand, Hoi An offers two lovely beaches which are five kilometers away from the town center. Renting a bike, riding around the town to enjoy the peaceful atmosphere is really enjoyable..<br/>
